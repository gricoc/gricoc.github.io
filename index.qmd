I am an associate professor at the [political science department](https://www.uab.cat/ca/ciencia-politica-dret-public) at [Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona](https://www.uab.cat/). My research interests are in the fields of political behavior and public opinion. My work, mostly quantitative, has focused on aspects such as populist attitudes, emotions, political socialization, and political leadership. I am a member of the research group on [Democracy, Elections and Citizenship (DEC)](https://webs.uab.cat/grdec/).
